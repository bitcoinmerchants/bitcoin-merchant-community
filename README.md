## Criteria for bitcoin POS solutions to be included on the BMC website

The BMC seeks to include a wide variety of point-of-sale solutions that allow merchants to accept bitcoin payments irrespective of which system they currently use or where they may be located—provided the solution can make evidence of adoption, ease of use and/or other unique value proposition. 

If you are a bitcoin POS software vendor, please [get in touch with the BMC](mailto:bitcoinmerchants@spiral.xyz) describing how your solution meets the following criteria for inclusion: 

**1. Targets bitcoin payment acceptance in the in-person retail use case**
 - Provide evidence of in-person retail merchant adoption.
 - Provide a reference/quote from at least one quote from physical retail merchant using it.

**2. Ease of set-up**
 - Explain the specific steps a merchant would need to follow to get up and running with bitcoin payments with your solution. Please provide screenshots, links to product documentation and/or video tutorials or any other materail that would help understand the getting started UX.

**3. Ease of use**
 - Describe the UX for a customer making a bitcoin payment with your solution at a merchant. Again please provide screenshots and/or any other documentation that helps illustrate the customer experience.

**4. Any other unique value proposition?**
 - Is there anything else about your solution that would qualify it as particularly notable for merchant awareness? 

**5. Assets**
